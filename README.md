**Before you use it:** This project is still a work in progress and a lot of the features might not be implemented yet or might have bugs which make them unusable!

---

**Whiskey** is a **Music Player** made for use with the addon [**Starfall Ex**](https://github.com/thegrb93/StarfallEx).  
It will feature an advanced UI to simplify it's use and make it's features easily accessible.  
A **sharing** and **streaming** system is also planned to let you and your friends share or listen to music together.

## Current Status
The music player is currently not usable as it's basic features have not been implemented yet.  
Those include:
- UI
- Adding Music
- Playing Music

They will be worked on in order and once implemented, using the player will be possible.

Once downloaded, open the `zip` file.  
There should be another folder inside called `Whiskey-main`. This is the file you want.  
Then go to your Starfall data folder (`GarrysMod/garrysmod/data/starfall`) and drop the `Whiskey-main` folder in there.  
You can rename the folder (Like removing the `-main` part) but it is not necessary.

Once this is done, you can open your starfall editor in-game and you should be able to find the folder you added.  
If you don't, try pressing the refresh button at the bottom left:
